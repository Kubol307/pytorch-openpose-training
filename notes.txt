First 10 layers of body model are the same as in VGG-19. This part is responsible for feature extraction.
VGG-19 are not the only choice for feature extractor. Mobilenet and Resnet also are used in some implementations.

Steps for fine tuning neural network:
- Backbone is first 10 layers of neural network
- Load all weights
- Delete remaining layers
- Create new model with layers that come after Backbone
- Pass output of backbone to input of new model
- Train weights of new neural network

Depending on which part of body is added, limbSeq, mapIdx and colors in util.py and train_body.ipynb needs to be changed according to chosed keypoints
